## Description

[Nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) framework TypeScript starter repository.

## Project setup

```bash
$ yarn install
```

## Compile and run the project

```bash
# development
$ yarn run start

# watch mode
$ yarn run start:dev

# production mode
$ yarn run start:prod
```

## Database Configuration for Local Development

This application supports two modes for database authentication, configured via the `DB_AUTH_MODE` environment variable. This is primarily to facilitate local development against a standard PostgreSQL instance while using IAM-based authentication in deployed environments (like Cloud Run).

### Authentication Modes

1.  **IAM Authentication (Default)**
    *   If `DB_AUTH_MODE` is **not set** or set to any value other than `STANDARD`, the application will attempt to use IAM-based authentication.
    *   This is the default mode for deployed environments.
    *   **For Deployed Environments (e.g., Cloud Run):**
        *   `DB_INSTANCE_CONNECTION_NAME`: The Cloud SQL instance connection name (e.g., `your-project:your-region:your-instance`). This is configured in Terraform.
        *   `DB_USER_NAME`: For deployed services, this is **automatically set to the service account email** of the Cloud Run service itself (e.g., `your-backend-sa@your-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com`). This is configured in Terraform and usually not overridden for the deployed service.
        *   `DB_NAME`: The name of the database (e.g., `bjj_academy_app_db`). This is configured in Terraform.
        *   `GCP_REGION`: The GCP region where the Cloud SQL instance is located (e.g., `europe-west1`).
    *   **For Local Development using IAM against a Cloud SQL instance:**
        *   Set `DB_AUTH_MODE` to any value other than `STANDARD` (or leave it unset).
        *   `DB_INSTANCE_CONNECTION_NAME`: As above.
        *   `DB_USER_NAME`: **Must be set to your personal Google IAM user email** (e.g., `developer.email@example.com`).
            *   Your IAM user must be granted the `roles/cloudsql.client` permission in the GCP project.
            *   A Cloud SQL IAM user must be created for your email: `gcloud sql users create developer.email@example.com --instance=INSTANCE_NAME --type=CLOUD_IAM_USER`.
        *   `DB_NAME`: As above.
        *   `GCP_REGION`: As above.
        *   Ensure you are authenticated with GCP Application Default Credentials (e.g., by running `gcloud auth application-default login`).

2.  **Standard Username/Password Authentication**
    *   To use standard username and password authentication (e.g., for a local Dockerized PostgreSQL instance), set `DB_AUTH_MODE=STANDARD`.
    *   Required environment variables for `STANDARD` mode:
        *   `DB_HOST`: The hostname of the database server (e.g., `localhost`).
        *   `DB_PORT`: The port number of the database server (e.g., `5432`).
        *   `DB_USER_NAME`: The database username (e.g., `postgres`). (Note: if `DB_AUTH_MODE=STANDARD` is set, this `DB_USER_NAME` is used, not an IAM email).
        *   `DB_PASSWORD`: The password for the database username.
        *   `DB_NAME`: The name of the database (e.g., `bjj_academy_dev`).

### A Note on Terraform Variables

The infrastructure for this backend (including Cloud SQL instance and user setup for deployed environments) is managed by Terraform. Key points regarding recent changes:
-   The Terraform variable `db_user_name` (previously for setting a custom IAM user name) has been removed. The deployed service now uses its own service account email as the database IAM user, configured directly in Terraform.
-   Terraform variables `db_instance_name_prefix` (for the Cloud SQL instance name, with a random suffix added) and `db_name` (for the database name) now have sensible defaults in `terraform/variables.tf`. These typically do not need to be overridden via CI/CD environment variables for the primary deployment.

### Example `.env` file for Local Development (Standard Auth)

Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory root for local development:

```env
# .env file for backend local development

# Database Configuration
DB_AUTH_MODE=STANDARD
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_USER_NAME=your_local_db_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_local_db_password
DB_NAME=your_local_db_name

# Other environment variables if needed by your application
# For example, if running the NestJS app on a different port:
# PORT=3001
```

**Note:** Ensure your local PostgreSQL instance is running and accessible with the credentials provided. The `.env` file is typically loaded by `dotenv` (which is included in `data-source.ts`). Remember to add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file to avoid committing credentials.

## Run tests

```bash
# unit tests
$ yarn run test

# e2e tests
$ yarn run test:e2e

# test coverage
$ yarn run test:cov
```

## Deployment

When you're ready to deploy your NestJS application to production, there are some key steps you can take to ensure it runs as efficiently as possible. Check out the [deployment documentation](https://docs.nestjs.com/deployment) for more information.

If you are looking for a cloud-based platform to deploy your NestJS application, check out [Mau](https://mau.nestjs.com), our official platform for deploying NestJS applications on AWS. Mau makes deployment straightforward and fast, requiring just a few simple steps:

```bash
$ yarn install -g @nestjs/mau
$ mau deploy
```

With Mau, you can deploy your application in just a few clicks, allowing you to focus on building features rather than managing infrastructure.
