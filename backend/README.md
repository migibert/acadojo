## Description

[Nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) framework TypeScript starter repository.

## Project setup

```bash
$ yarn install
```

## Compile and run the project

```bash
# development
$ yarn run start

# watch mode
$ yarn run start:dev

# production mode
$ yarn run start:prod
```

## Database Configuration for Local Development

This application supports two modes for database authentication, configured via the `DB_AUTH_MODE` environment variable. This is primarily to facilitate local development against a standard PostgreSQL instance while using IAM-based authentication in deployed environments (like Cloud Run).

### Authentication Modes

1.  **IAM Authentication (Default)**
    *   If `DB_AUTH_MODE` is **not set** or set to any value other than `STANDARD`, the application will attempt to use IAM-based authentication.
    *   This is the default mode for deployed environments.
    *   Required environment variables for IAM mode:
        *   `DB_INSTANCE_CONNECTION_NAME`: The Cloud SQL instance connection name (e.g., `your-project:your-region:your-instance`).
        *   `DB_USER_NAME`: The database user configured for IAM authentication (e.g., `iam_user_name_in_db`). This is **not** the service account email.
        *   `DB_NAME`: The name of the database (e.g., `bjj_academy_db`).
        *   `GCP_REGION`: The GCP region where the Cloud SQL instance is located (e.g., `europe-west1`). This helps the Cloud SQL Connector.

2.  **Standard Username/Password Authentication**
    *   To use standard username and password authentication (e.g., for a local Dockerized PostgreSQL instance), set `DB_AUTH_MODE=STANDARD`.
    *   Required environment variables for `STANDARD` mode:
        *   `DB_HOST`: The hostname of the database server (e.g., `localhost`).
        *   `DB_PORT`: The port number of the database server (e.g., `5432`).
        *   `DB_USER_NAME`: The database username (e.g., `postgres`).
        *   `DB_PASSWORD`: The password for the database username.
        *   `DB_NAME`: The name of the database (e.g., `bjj_academy_dev`).

### Example `.env` file for Local Development (Standard Auth)

Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory root for local development:

```env
# .env file for backend local development

# Database Configuration
DB_AUTH_MODE=STANDARD
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_USER_NAME=your_local_db_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_local_db_password
DB_NAME=your_local_db_name

# Other environment variables if needed by your application
# For example, if running the NestJS app on a different port:
# PORT=3001
```

**Note:** Ensure your local PostgreSQL instance is running and accessible with the credentials provided. The `.env` file is typically loaded by `dotenv` (which is included in `data-source.ts`). Remember to add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file to avoid committing credentials.

## Run tests

```bash
# unit tests
$ yarn run test

# e2e tests
$ yarn run test:e2e

# test coverage
$ yarn run test:cov
```

## Deployment

When you're ready to deploy your NestJS application to production, there are some key steps you can take to ensure it runs as efficiently as possible. Check out the [deployment documentation](https://docs.nestjs.com/deployment) for more information.

If you are looking for a cloud-based platform to deploy your NestJS application, check out [Mau](https://mau.nestjs.com), our official platform for deploying NestJS applications on AWS. Mau makes deployment straightforward and fast, requiring just a few simple steps:

```bash
$ yarn install -g @nestjs/mau
$ mau deploy
```

With Mau, you can deploy your application in just a few clicks, allowing you to focus on building features rather than managing infrastructure.
